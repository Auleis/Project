## INTRO
Dungeons and Dragons, or D&D, is a Table top Roleplaying game in which you create a character to explore a world made by someone else. An important, and arguably diffucult part of this is making your character and creating a "Character Sheet" for them. This stores all the information you will ever need about your character for their stats, to what they have on them.
You will also need the "Players Hand Book" (PHB) book at minimum to create a character sheet.

## What is the character sheet?
the character sheets look can vary some, but the offical one is the following

## Before working on the sheet
You should figure out what type of character you will be playing. Who they are, what they want, why they do things etc. This is to give an idea of what you want to do.
Once you figure ou the basic information about them, such as name, Personality, Flaws, height, etc, write these down in their respective boxs.

## Step 1- Determine your Characters stats
One of the first things to do is to figure out your characters stats. there are several methods described in the PHB including "Standard Array" which has the following stats, 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 and the "4d6d1" method which involves 4 six sided die, and then subtracting the lowest die rolled for each of your 6 stats.

## Step 2- Assign the stats
After you have determined how you will get your characters stats is to assign them. In the six boxs on the left side of the sheet you should put assign the numbers you have to each box relating to how good your character is at that skill. They included Strength (STR) Dextirity (DEX) Constitution (CON) Intelegence (INT) Wisodom (WIS) and Charasima (CHA).

## Step 3- Pick your characters race
The next thing you should do after deciding who your character is, is *what* your character is. Using any of the races in the PHB decide what race best fits your character. Keep note of what all the race entails as each race has its own benifits, ranging from abilities, "Proficences" which we will get to shortly, how fast they are (Their speed) and others. 

## Step 4- Add your race stat benefits
Each race also gives boosts to some of your stats. Add these stat boosts to the stats you determied before.

## Step 5- Determine your stat modifiers
The first things your stats affect are your "Stat Modifyers" or "Stat mods" Take each stats number, Divide it by 2, and then subtract 5. Always round down, and this number is your stat mod. Write this number in the small circle below each of the stat numbers in their boxs. 

## Step 6- Determine your characters background
now we step away from numbers for a bit. It is now time to chose a background for your character. Read through the list of backgrounds in the PHB and pick one most fitting for your character. Each background offers different skill proficiences, items, unique features and flavor for your character. 

## Step 7- Determine your characters Proficiences
Proficiences are what your character is good at. Sometimes your race will offer some, your background offers two, and your class will offer anywhere between 2 and 4. If you gain proficency in a skill, mark that down by circling the bubble next to the skills name. 

## About proficency bonus
each character has a "Proficency bonus" this is a number added to any dice roll that uses a skill you are proficent in. As your character levels up, they get better at things they are proficent at. There is a table in the PHB that tells you what your proficeny bonus is at each level. 

## Step 8- Pick your characters class
Next up is to pick what class your character best belongs to. There are a bunch of classes, Read through each one and pick whatever best fits your character. The class you pick will also offer some proficiencys you should also mark down. Your class will also give you equipment which you should write down in your "Equipment" list.

## Step 9- Write down your characters powers and abilities
once you have picks your class, you will now gain powers and abilities. Each class offers differnt things at different levels. If your character is level 1, Write down everything your character gets at level one. 

## Step 10- Determine your characters HitPoints, and HitDie
Each level your character gains Hit points and Hit Die. For your hit points at level one you take the maximum number from what your class says to roll (If you roll a d8, take 8) and add your CON mod. This is your hitpoints at level one.

# And that's it!
Your character sheet is now complete.
